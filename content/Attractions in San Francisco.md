# Attractions in San Francisco

_Part of a series on [[Attractions per city]]._
## Food
### Iconic / best food places
- Kitchen story / sweet maple (iconic)
- [[4505 Burgers & BBQ]] (9/10 burger from [[The best burger in the bay area]])
    - [[True Food Kitchen]] is the only 10/10 but it's in Palo Alto not SF.
- Dumpling home: Literally some of the best dumplings I've had in my life. Several of my friends from China say it's better than the upscale places in Shanghai. Get anything here except the boiled dumplings because that's a tough dish to be remarkable at.
- The Public Izakaya: Pricier but great. They have a cabinet filled with free Japanese snacks you can munch on with friends while you wait for your food. Chirashi bowl is amazing.
- State Bird Provisions if you like good food but also spending money and having a hard time getting a reservation
- Tacos El Patron has the best _traditional_ tacos in SF that I've ever had.
- Lolo's in Mission has the best tacos I've had period, although they are contemporary/funky. Best mid-scale Mexican food I've ever had. Get the tuna tacons; they are tuna tacos with entire pieces of fish in them

### Desserts
- Arsicault (either location): Literally the best chocolate croissant I've ever had, and the internet agrees.
- U dessert story has amazing bingsu
- Naya
- Pineapple buns place
- Tartine's. Super high quality pastries.
- Sul and Beans in Cupertino has great bingsu too

### Other food
- Chucks takeaway in Mission. $16 sandwiches where they make everything in house: the bread, hot sauce, pickled vegetables, ... Also they have Korean peanut butter custard buns. [[2022-11-05]]
- Golden Boy Pizza in North Beach is an institution. Idk if it's my thing but everyone likes it. It gets a hella long line though so arrive early
- Technically not SF, but [Seapot Daly City](https://goo.gl/maps/uoC2yKyLQbEjh2dX9) is a fantastic hotpot place if you have access to a car.
- Also tec

### Boba
- 0& in Hayes Valley
- Little Sweet
- See [[Best boba orders]] for my SF ratings

## Sights
- Palace of Fine Arts
- Twin Peaks (bring a jacket)
- Hayes Valley
- Golden Gate Park. JFK Drive is a 100% foot traffic area now as of 2022's Proposition J, so you can walk through it and take in a bunch of the nice sights and art. Note: Do NOT bring a car here as parking is abysmal (because of Prop J). Just Uber or take public transit.
- Ghiradhelli Square
- Wave Organ is kind of neat

## Bars
- Polk St bars
    - Jackalope: dive-adjacent the Tenderloin (not the best neighborhood) but they have a loft overlooking the bar with a fantastic condition NES where you can play the original Kirby's Adventure and Mario Bros 2 on
    - Harper & Rye: lively clean spacious bar with nice topology
    - Bob's Donuts: open 24/7 and sell giant donuts (bigger than your head; go w friends) to drunk people. There's usually a line out the door even late at night. A treasure
- Sycamore in Mission
- Sugar Lounge in Hayes: my fav bar in SF. Very simple cocktail bar with occasional free snacks at the door. There's a secret table in the back that looks like it's reservation only but it's totally not and you can use it
- Emporium is a neat arcade bar but it's not my thing

## Misc
- [Sofar sounds SF](https://www.sofarsounds.com/cities/san-francisco) has pop-up music shows
- 68 Castro St has pretty Christmas lights during holiday time: https://maps.app.goo.gl/1DunFZmi3iaUJ4Rn8
- Chateau Tivoli bed and breakfast is a really cool looking hotel I noticed in [[2023-04-16]]. I have no reason to go since I live here but could be a fun experience for visitors
- https://bucketlisters.com/explore/city/SF
- Also the farmers market in Embarcadero for BIG NEWTON. It's sold in the back at a stand called Downtown Bakery & Creamery. See [[2023-04-29]] for a pic.
- Things Lucky Handicraft in Haight-Ashbury is a super vibey crafts supply store that is the only operating commercial store on Page St. They've been there for over a decade. Calm vibe. Nice to wander around and see/feel all the textures.
