# Attractions in New York City
#publish
_Part of a series on [[Attractions per city]]._

A lot of these recs come from my experience during 2022's Thanksgiving trip, beginning [[2022-11-25]].

## Food
- Bread and Spread in Dumbo for hole-in-the-wall sandwiches. Best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. Went there [[2023-03-04]].
- Cha Cha Matcha. There's a few locations. Incredible matcha chai; I got mine with almond milk (or oat milk?)
- Kenka, a cheap (yes, actually cheap, not just by NYC standards) izakaya. You may have to wait to get in. Visited [[2023-11-19]]. My fav budget restaurant. Vibes are immaculate and rather rowdy
- Anita Gelato near Flatiron. Sooo good and I don't typically like ice cream.
- Fish Cheeks, a fancy and expensive but totally worth it Thai restaurant. Visited [[2023-11-26]].
- NOTE TO SELF: I should figure out how to organize restaurant recs... there's an epidemic of good restaurants in NYC and a Google Maps list is probably better than the markdown here.

## Attractions
- The free weekend IKEA ferry leaving from Pier 76. I left on 4:30 on a Saturday and had the whole thing to myself and Chris plus we got to see the sunset. Great date idea or general activity near the Whitney museum area.
- Whitney museum. Buy tickets in advance, the time you want may not be available last minute.
- Chelsea Market
- Pier 54. It's an artificial island made of concrete spires that's home to a concert venue / great sunset watching location.
- The MoMA. If you want $10 off you can you can buy a student ticket when checking out at a kiosk, they don't check student ID.
- Bryant Park, particularly in wintertime for the holiday market
  - There's a Japanese bookstore 1 block down which is fun too.
- Grand Central station's whispering walls. There's a spot in the first level basement level (you can walk there from the normal ramp) where you can speak straight into a wall and your friend behind you on opposite side of the room an hear you as if you're right next to them. I took a video of this on [[2023-11-10]] in my camera roll.
