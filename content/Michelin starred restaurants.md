# Michelin-starred restaurants

## Philosophy
I think there are really only two categories of Michelin-starred restaurants:
1) Ones that produce exceptional renditions of timeless dishes (e.g. filet mignon, beef wellington).
2) Ones that produce new and novel dishes that you almost literally cannot experience anywhere but there. These restaurants often have rotating or seasonal menus.

I strongly prefer type 2.
