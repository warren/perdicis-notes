# Event finder trifecta
#publish 
Came up with this [[2023-11-10]] but only opened the page [[2023-12-03]].

In a nutshell, by combining:
- EventBrite
- Meetup
- AllEvents.in
- (SF only) https://sf.funcheap.com
    - https://funcheapsfmap.com

You can find some decent options in any city.

Update [[2023-12-30]]: Can use https://lu.ma/explore to find some too. I think it's just for tech events and that guy Spice King's events: https://lu.ma/nyparty
