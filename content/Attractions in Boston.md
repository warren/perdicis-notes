# Attractions in Boston
#publish
_Part of a series on [[Attractions per city]]._

- Harvard campus
- Harvard bridge
- MIT
- BU, particularly bay state rd which is filled with beautiful brownstones. I used to live in the French House (can find on Google maps)
- Esplanade trail by the Charles river. Walk the whole way and you'll reach Gloucester St Dock which is perfect for sunbathing, drawing, or eating some takeout food w friends. (!)
- Boston Public Gardens
- Acorn St / general beacon Hill area (!)
- Mapparium
- Isabella Stewart Gardner museum
- Area around ICA
- ICA if you like bad art
- The friendly toast for brunch
- veggie galaxy
- faneuil Hall
- buy kayak cookies. They are chunky 1-2" thick camping cookies sold exclusively at whole foods in the Boston area. One of my fav pantry cookies (!)
- Boston public library
- Newbury St just for walking around, getting boba, finding a cute restaurant (!)
- Mike's pastries. Any location but especially the north end location
- Jonquil's bakery on Newbury St for aesthetically pleasing (and actually amazing tasting) mousse desserts. They sell out by midday so get there early! (!)
- Yamato II for a wide range of AYCE sushi and kitchen entrees (sushi is honestly mediocre but price is good. Also Roy Kim was the reason this restaurant had to institute a time limit back in 2017)
- trident booksellers, which is a multi story brunch place built into a bookstore on the ground floor
