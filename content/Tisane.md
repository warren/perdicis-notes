Boba store in San Jose. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Melon Rouge // 0% sugar // Lychee jelly
_Organic oolong tea infused with strawberry, melon, and lychee._
7.25/10. A little bit too sweet. And they combined the lychee jelly with another topping I didn't ask for but ostensibly came as part of the drink preset.

This was the third boba order I added to [[Best boba orders]] and it was a major outlier based on [[My food rating system]]. I retroactively lowered my rating 8.5->7.25/10.
