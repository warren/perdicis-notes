Most of the content here comes from a conversation I had with Preeti on [[2022-04-27]].

I argue that TikTok's engine is not good at figuring out "which things you like"; it's good at figuring out "which 10 second-long videos you like." The two are totally separate concepts in my mind.

Proof of this/a related concept: I often add long documentaries to my "Watch later" playlist on YouTube about niche topics, like the life of an African warlord. Yet I don't watch many of these. Am I deluding myself into thinking I enjoy these topics since I don't watch them? Is this an example of [[Bad faith]]? I don't think so. I think the cost-risk-benefit analysis simply leads me (and others) to consume a 10 second long TikTok video easily since the risk is low and the benefit is high; and when I consider watching a 25 minute documentary about African warlords, the risk of costing me 25 minutes of my time is significant.

So perhaps TikTok's short form videos are a tool for good. They provide a low risk / low cost method for people to break into their potential new interests.

But it doesn't feel that way to me.
