Opened [[2024-06-26]] while pondering [[Burning Man]].

Flow arts is basically just dancing with an object. Any object works. But many of them work better than others, including:
- Poi (very popular)
- [[Contact staff]] (my chosen prop) 
- Fans
- Rope dart
- Spinning staff
- Dragon staff
- Hula hoops
- Many others
