Boba store in the SF Marina. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Misc notes
Popcorn chicken portions here are _amazing_ value for size and taste.

Boba containers are weirdly stumpy. But I'm pretty sure they have more tea in them as a result.


## Drinks
### "C3" Lemon green tea // 0% sugar // Lychee jelly
8.25/10.

Idrk how to rate this. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the drink but nothing particularly right about it. I could imagine rating it higher or lower depending on the mood I'm in when drinking it. Overall I liked it. The volume of tea and toppings I got for $5.25 is definitely above average as compared to other boba shops.

Weird thing to complain about but the lychee jelly chunks were too big to routinely fit into my straw. So I missed a lot of them. I didn't change my rating based on this.
