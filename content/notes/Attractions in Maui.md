# Attractions in Maui
#publish
_Part of a series on [[Attractions per city]]. Ok, Maui is technically an island but you can drive anywhere in 90 minutes._

Went here between [[2022-09-07]] and [[2022-09-10]].
- Dynamite donuts. You order in advance and pick up in a 4 hour window on Saturdays.
- Leoda's Kitchen and Pie shop, known for their pies. https://goo.gl/maps/nWz8UXB43qNJJfdF6
- Sugar Beach Bake Shop, which has really nice macarons. See [[2022-09-08]] for a pic.
- For good poke, visit either Foodland or Tamura's market. The poke places in the backs of these grocery stores are representative of real Hawaiian poke (source: Javier).
	- Costco also sells poke. But it's actually more expensive and you can't choose the quantity to buy.
