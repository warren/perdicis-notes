Boba store in San Jose, really close to Roy's old apartment at 1011 Giacomo Lane in San Jose. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Strawberry Hibiscus (decaf) // Can't modify sugar // Crystal boba
6.5/10. A little better than what I expected.

I can't rate this much higher though because the sweetness isn't modifiable. Taste is great, but it's still overly sweet and 100 cal not counting the boba.

### Green Thai Tea // lowest possible sweetness // crystal boba
Roy's favorite. I tried a brief taste and liked it.

5.5/10. It's pretty good. But really sweet. I docked a lot of points for the unadjustable sweetness because boba pearls would have been better here but I couldn't have any because the combined sweetness would be too much.
