### Terminology
X-Y-Z indicates width, in mm, for the front tip, middle, and tail.

### The ideal ski for me
95-100 underfoot
Lower end of 175ish length
Early rise + all-mountain rocker
Single plated (light)

Consider:
- stiffer vs softer
- big rocker vs small rocker

### 2023 season demos
**Atomic Blackeye T1s**
- 174cm length
- 16m turn radius
- 125.5-82-110.5
- my old skis from 2012

**Armada Declivities**
- Chris' ski
- 172cm
- 102 underfoot
- I never got to demo these, just heard about them through Chris

**88 Stormriders**
- rented at sun valley [[2023-01-08]]
- 128-88-114
- 175cm length
- Notes
    - Waaay better at coasting than my K2s. But that's probably because they're unscratched.
    - Heavier. That's a bad thing. I feel more awkward taking jumps and it's harder to throw my skis side to side.
    - Excellent feeling for coasting down the half-groomed half-powder snowfall on the slopes traveling largely straight with small turns.

**Nordica Enforcer 94s**
- 172cm
- 126.5-94-114.5
- these felt really good. Easily the best ski I used throughout the Sun Valley trip.
- can pump
- no rattling
- they feel light (single plated?)
- perform OK on powder

**M6 Mantras**
- 177cm
- 135-96-119
- these are heavy af.
- rattle on groomers

**Stormrider 95s**
- 175cm
- perfectly fine skis but I didn't love them for some reason.

**Nordica Enforcers 104 Free**
- 172cm
- 134-104-123
- Length seems good
- Noticably better on powder
- Seems a bit harder to turn than the 94s.
  - Might just be due to tiredness 
- I found, when I fell, it was often because the back of the ski got caught/I had trouble leaning back somehow. I am guessing this is due to the free rider shape.

**Blizzard Rustler 10s**
- 180cm
- 133-102-122.5
- No rattling
- Good on powder but there wasn't much powder
- Had a bit of trouble turning while on groomers. But I wasn't very tired so it might be even harder to turn in reality.
- Rented [[2023-01-21]] at Heavenly (when the snow conditions were pretty lame)

### 2024 Rentals
**Nordica Enforcer 94s (again)**
172cm
126.5-94-114.5
- Guy says they're heavy-ish


**Rossignol Sender 94s**
172cm
128-94-118
- No rocker in the back
- Very thin in the front
- Good for carving
- Wide makes it good for po rer

**Nordica Enforcer 100s**
- [[2024-01-07]]
- Way more stable
- Also way harder to turn. Or maybe I'm just tired from yesterday?
- _Still rattles_ at high speed. 
- Doesn't feel meaningfully better on powder due to its weight
- so I guess a 94 underfoot is right for me and it's just between the two I tried.
