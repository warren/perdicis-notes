# Local Kitchen & Wine Merchant

_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Rather soulless-ly decorated brunch restaurant in Rincon Hill I visited on [[2022-11-20]] with Ayush, Jun, Lisa, and Mounica that against all odds serves an exceptional burger. This is the last place I'd expect to find one!

Ingredients were largely basic: a seeded Bun, pickles, and no cheese for some reason. I rated it 0.5 unusualness.

The burger has a bitter and vaguely sour aftertaste from their house sauce. I loved that. I'd rate the burger around 8.75/10, not quite a 9/10. I could bump it higher if there were more meat or if it were warmer; the dish was served pretty cold.

The burger came with a choice of fries or salad. I took the salad, which wasn't terrible but it had olives in it. I thought it was eh.

Unfortunately the burger is $22 which doesn't seem very worth it. But it was really good.

Update from sometime in the future: it's called "Local Kitchen & Wine Merchant" because all their food is locally sourced. That explains the quality but guys you should call someone about your branding I explicitly avoided this place because of the name for ages
