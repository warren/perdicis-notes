My pet theory that the _only_ computer that can compute the future state of the universe is necessarily one that is the size of the universe. In other words, we are living in the computer program and the the program is running on reality.

Corollary: Although a future universe state may theoretically be predictable, it is never actually predictable. Except perhaps in small, isolated corners of the universe untouched by all external forces. Maybe such corners don't exist though, and influences as benign as light from distant stars would disrupt otherwise predictable worlds.

 So, the only computer that knows all the rules of physics and can execute predictions flawlessly is reality itself.
