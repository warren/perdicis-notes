## Common playstyles and tells
### General
- Merlin can be seen rejecting teams he is on as he knows the evil on his team

### As Percival
- To better distinguish Merlin from Morgana:
  - Watch for Morgana upvoting a team with Merlin on it.

## As Morberon
- Fail first.

## As Morgana
- be assertive and don't hesitate so Percival will follow you

## As Mordred
- Discredit Merlin by acting as Percival

## As clueless good
- Be ok with getting carried
- Still try to figure out who is who by round 2
