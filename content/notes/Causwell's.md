_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Restaurant in the SF Marina I visited on [[2022-07-17]]. They won an award for their burger on Eater.

The Philly cheeseburger sounds good, which is a double smash burger patty, provolone, onions, mushrooms, and aioli. However it's not available until after 3pm so I didn't try it.

Instead I got the Americana burger which is a double smash burger of some sort.

Holy moly this food was terrible. The bun was untoasted and cold, the meat overcooked, and the whole sandwich was almost devoid of toppings. There was a paper thin layer of lettuce, a tiny portion of paper-thinly sliced onions and pickles, and no tomato at all. It was like 50% patty, 45% bun, and 5% toppings. It was missing tomato too? 0.5 for unusualness but the real important number here will be the rating...

The only pro I can think of is: it's not greasy. But that was still perplexing because it's a double smash burger -- I feel like removing the leftover oil and juices detracts from what makes smash burgers tasty to begin with.

Burger cost $19 with fries being an extra $2 (or a salad, which is free). I got the salad which was absolutely drenched in dressing, bordering on inedible.

I can't fathom how this restaurant made Eater 38's list. Surely I must have visited on an off day?
