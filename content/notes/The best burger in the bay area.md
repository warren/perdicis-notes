## Philosophy behind these ratings
It's hard to rate a burger definitively "X/10" because burgers have a wide variety of ingredients and degrees of fanciness - you're often not comparing the same type of burger to the next.

In general, my philosophy is that the "X/10" rating should only indicate how much I liked the burger. Points aren't docked for ingredients, nor price point, nor whether the burger came with fries - however it's still good to surface all these things so I include a second "unusualness factor" rating in each review denoting roughly how far the burger being reviewed deviates from staple ingredients. Also, while not noted in the table, I mention in each review whether the burger comes with fries.

My guidelines for for unusualness ratings:
- +5 is the default unusualness factor for plant-based burgers since by forgoing meat, a restaurant is already pushing the definition of a burger.
- Unusual but not unheard of toppings like fried egg or arugula earn a +1 unusualness factor each (exceptions made for tiny variations like a noticeably seeded bun, pickles, caramelized onions, or mushrooms: +0.5 instead).
- Very unusual toppings like Brie cheese earn a minimum +1.5 unusualness factor each.
- Strange lack of default toppings like cheese earns somewhere between +0-0.5 unusualness.

Example rating from the [[Spruce]] review:
> 2.75/10 unusualness due to:
> - Taleggio (+1.5)
> - English muffin bun (+1)
> - Pickled onion (+0.25 as onions are staple but it's unusual to pickle them)
