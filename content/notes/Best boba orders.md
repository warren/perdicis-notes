# Best boba orders
#publish
Using [[My food rating system]] to set ratings. Ratings are X/10.

The reason I use non-relational ratings instead of relational ratings (like I do in [[The best burger in the bay area]]) is to account for the huge variance between different drinks -- it's often impossible to compare boba stores apples-to-apples, so I compare per-drink.
