# Cool Tea Bar / My Cup of Tea
#publish
It's called My Cup of Tea on Doordash. Maybe a [[Ghost kitchens|ghost kitchen]]?

Boba store. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Taro milk tea // 0% sugar // "cool balls"
2.5/10. Holy shit this was bad. It's bordering on inedible territory but not quite there. I drank about 1/4 of this before thinking better of myself.

- Milky colored; not purple at all.
- Didn't taste like how I expect taro to taste at all - it was like straight oat milk.
- Couldn't tell if 0% sweet was honored; it tasted like Splenda sweetness.
- "Cool balls" was simply crystal boba. This part was fine but who was in charge of that name lol.
- How does this store stay in business??
