[[2022-07-14]]: Woke up using [[Ritalin]] and found that I remembered my dream as I did.

I forgot it quickly but I recall being in a room with goofy whiteboard drawings describing the plot of outer wilds with chronological arrows pointing to cute diagrams.

It occurs to me that my brain is a really advanced version of Imagen/DALLE. Maybe lucid dreaming is a way to harness the human brain for image generation. Maybe there's a way to scan someone's brain as they do it to figure out how they do it?
