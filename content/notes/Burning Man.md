## Notes
#### Kim's advice from [[2024-03-26]]
She carries multiple gifts to people of a wide range of quality. She's camped for 8 years; this will be her 9th!

Gifts to the playa ideas/things she's done:
- Fancy lip balm (people's lips get chapped)
- Carabiner-ed gifts for easy carry
- Water sprayers to cool down
- Masks that look pretty since ppl lose theirs?
- Cooling towels: special kind of towel you can wet, shake, and they are cool

She brings 2 thermoses. One is fancy and nice which she keeps at the camp. One is carabiner-ed to her as she walks around.

Camps she's camped with:
- Moon cheese, they do something related to cheese at midnight
- Gravity: they make a big disco ball with DJs and bar. She did this last year. Maybe will again?
- Some Googler-started camp that does giant fire structures

There's some mingling events happening rn that I might want to attend to find a themecamp.
