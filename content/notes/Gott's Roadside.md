_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Casual upscale American fast food place I visited on [[2022-04-10]] with Sharon.

(There are multiple locations, but I went to https://maps.app.goo.gl/FtczhPZ4aSQJByCz7)

Their burger had arugula and an egg in it, earning a 2/10 unusualness factor.

Overall quality was good. The bun was pretty crispy. Normal levels of greasy.

Unrelated but the chicken tenders were pretty good.

Didn't come with fries.
