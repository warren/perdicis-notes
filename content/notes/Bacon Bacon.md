_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

A Spark Social food truck I visited on [[2022-07-27]] that sells a lot of things pork related. One item is a Double Bacon Burger. I got that. I asked them to hold the bacon because it seemed heavy and I didn't see their food truck name. I hope the guy wasn't offended.

Burger ingredients are super generic. It's a double patty with lettuce, tomato, cheddar, and bacon (which I asked them to hold).

7.5/10 rating. It's better than [[Super Duper Burgers]] but just barely.


Cost was $16.
