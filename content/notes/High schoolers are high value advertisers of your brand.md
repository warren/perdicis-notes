# High schoolers are high value advertisers of your brand

Opened [[2024-06-02]] from a conversation I had at a party [[2024-04-30]].

I want to say this belongs in [[Musings on tech]], but it's more like a tweet-sized thought.

The tweet goes thusly:
- Hiring influencers to advertise your brand is expensive (O(100s) of USD)
- Hiring high schoolers is... a lot cheaper.
- Depending on the nature of your brand (are you selling a thing? Or promoting interest in a free thing like software?), capturing the high schooler market may be more valuable.
    - High schoolers don't have money but are much better at organically building hype.
- Conclusion: if you can hire 10 high schoolers for the cost of 1 college influencer ... hmmm ... maybe??

Wait, how legal is it to hire high schoolers anyways?
