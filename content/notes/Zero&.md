Boba store in Hayes Valley. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Coconut Zero // 0 calorie sugar "less sweet" // Crystal boba
9/10. Really good. I would still rate this 9/10 without toppings too, since the drink is full of really fun textrous coconut pulp.

It came in a weird half coconut though. Next time I'll ask them to hold that. It doesn't affect the rating.

### Peach Oolong // 0 calorie sugar "less sweet" // Crystal boba // Hold the pine nuts but keep "signature oatly cloud"
7.5/10. I could've gotten it more sweet.

Even without the pine nuts I still detected the pine nut flavor from the "oatly cloud" (which is some substitute for a sweet cheese top). I didn't love that flavor.

### Coco melon // 0 calorie sugar "less sweet" // coconut pudding
8/10. Hard to rate because there isn't really a drink like this at other boba shops.

Honestly it's barely even boba. It's not even tea. It's just blended watermelon, some coconut milk, and pudding.

It's really good though.

### Grapefruit spa // 0 calorie sugar "less sweet" // crystal boba
5.25/10. I think the real issue is I don't like grapefruit much. Also the grapefruit slices get in the way of drinking all the tea.
