Opened [[2023-12-06]]. Had this idea during the [[2023 NYC trip]] on [[2023-11-25]] but I'd been angling to buy a receipt maker way earlier.

[[2023-11-27]]:
Ordered a thermal printer, an Adafruit model 597: https://www.adafruit.com/product/597

[[2023-12-06]]:
Ordered a few parts:
- Arduino Uno REV3
    - Because I need WiFi and I'm not gonna buy an ethernet shield.
    - Also has onboard Bluetooth in case I want that.
- USB B<->A 6' cable
- 2.25" thermal paper rolls
- ... I'm not sure what else. I'm not even sure how to Google for what I need. I guess I need to actually learn Arduino first.

So, ordered some parts for the first two classes of https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Class/ to play with:
- Adafruit mounting plate (PID 275)
- Budget bundle w/ Metro 328 board (PID 193)

Order #: 3187579-3749685222
