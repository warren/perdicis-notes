# Attractions in Seattle
#publish
_Part of a series on [[Attractions per city]]._

I don't visit Seattle often but when I did [[2023-06-18]] - [[2023-06-21]] this is what I did:
- Pike Market for a tourist-heavy but fascinating mashup of stores with cool topology
    - The gum wall is gross though ew
- Space Needle + Chihuly Glass Garden: staple tourist attraction. I liked the sheer scale of the glass garden.
- Elysian Brewery for IPA flights
- Hot Cakes: late night dessert place which sells lava cakes. Soo good.
- Gas Works Park. Kinda fun
    - The loop around Lake Union is runnable and only ~6.7mi if you're a runner

Alternatively: read [King's doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LYv69amSzheb3MvzcbEx54gV23D8ayg2jU6ps6aLmHk/edit) which is written by a real Seattle resident and way more detailed than my version ever will be.
