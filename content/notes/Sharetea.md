Boba store. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Peach kiwi black tea with aiyu jelly // 0% sugar // Lychee jelly
5.75/10. It tastes like generic fruit tea; I can't even make out the specific fruit.

Too sweet despite 0% sugar. But that's my fault for adding lychee jelly on top of the Aiyu jelly.


### Wintermelon Lemonade // 0% sugar // Agar jelly
7/10. I really like the melon+lemon flavor and the agar jelly is fantastic. Better than crystal boba imo.

Despite all it has going for it, it's way too sweet for 0% sugar and it's decaffeinated. Down to 7/10.

Note: Agar was printed "jelly ball (new)" on the cup 0% sugar.
