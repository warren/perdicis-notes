## Drinks
### Honeydew milk tea // 0% sugar // Aloe dices
7.25/10.

The aloe is great. I didn't realize this was a milk tea drink, and I didn't want milk, so unfortunately there's a limit to how high I can rate it.

The level of sweet was good I think. It was purely sweetened by the milk which I'm not sure is a flavor I love.
