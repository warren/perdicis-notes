## What is this
Games, mostly internet games, which can be used to compete against your friends. Inspired by Ludwig's BvB and originally called "The master decathlon" because it was the method Samarth and I were going to use to determine who got the master bedroom on [[2024-01-17]].

## Games
### Internet games
- Wikipedia race (played on Wikipedia -- see [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game))
- [The human benchmark](https://humanbenchmark.com/)
- [That game where you try to name all SF streets from memory](https://carvin.github.io/sf-street-names)
- [Geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/)
    - Note: requires $1 subscription :(
    - Hmu and you can use my account
- [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) - open this with a friend and race to craft something, almost literally anything you can think of is in here
- [Travle](https://travle.earth/) - Geography game about country adjacency
- [Movie to movie](https://movietomovie.com) - Movie/actor adjacency game
- [TimeGuessr](https://timeguessr.com/) - Guess the year and map location of iconic photos
- [PokeDoku](https://pokedoku.com) - Pokemon sudoku. DIFFICULT even if you know pokemon well.
- [MovieGrid.io](https://moviegrid.io) - Movie sudoku.
- [Guess the Game](guessthe.game) - shows screenshots of video games and you need to guess what video game it is

### Wordle variants
- [Semantle](https://semantle.com/) - my favorite. Guess words based on word2vec similarities
    - [Contexto](https://contexto.me/) - same thing just different website in case the first one breaks or you want a different puzzle
- [Tradle](https://wordlegame.org/wordle-games/tradle) - guess the country based on its exports
- [Costcodle](https://costcodle.com/) - guess the price of Costco goods
- [Bazingle](https://bazingle.wook.wtf/) - wordle but with 7 (glorious) letters


### Internet games (competitively viable)
- [Super Auto Pets](https://teamwood.itch.io/super-auto-pets) - simple turn-based battle royale you can get on phones and play with friends. Good for road trips
- [Pokemon showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) - competitive Pokemon battle simulator. DIFFICULT

### Actual video games
- Beat Saber - I will smoke anyone at this game
- LoL ARAM 1v1 - unfortunately requires downloading League of Legends. First to {100 creeps, tower kill, player elimination} wins
- Smash Bros 1v1 - self explanatory. Use [competitive ruleset](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Tournament_rulesets_(SSBU)) so it's a game of skill
- Discord golf minigame - People in the same Discord call can play this. It's fun

### Irl games:
- Chess
- Connect 4
- [Tellstones](https://www.tellstones.com/) - don't buy the physical game. Just learn the rules from [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0lol1-Xt3Q) and play with any 7 tokens (Pokemon energy cards are ideal, but playing cards are OK too)

Just for fun:
- [FromSoft word processor](https://woe-industries.itch.io/fromsoftword) - legit just a blank text word processor. 1 typo and it's game over
