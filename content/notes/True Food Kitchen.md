_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

This burger started it all. I first ate here 2021-05-27 and it planted the seed of an idea to create a Bay Area burger tier list. How fitting I should return here _for my first and only 10/10 rating.

The only downside of this burger is that the restaurant is located in Palo Alto, not SF. But I'm still putting it in my [[Attractions in San Francisco]] list.

In summary: It's simply a perfect 10/10; it's not even close to a 9/10. 1.75/10 unusualness factor (see below). Reviewed on [[2023-01-24]]. $19.5 and comes with a modest side of kale and sweet potatoes.

Unusualness calculation of 1.75:
- In-house ground beef patty (+0 since it's still beef, but you can really taste the difference in texture)
- Mushrooms (+0.25)
- Caramelized onions (+0.25)
- Arugula (+0.5)
- Parmesan (+0.5)
- Mayonnaise (+0.25)

((Writing this from the future; past Warren was so floored by the experience he forgot to revise his notes into a review. Here are the raw notes))
- Very juicy. Best cooked burger I think
- Umami of the mushrooms works well
- Drips juice but not too much
- Bread is perfectly toasted and crunchy. Maybe a better bun with more seeds could be used but its virtually perfect
- Like a backyard BBQ burger elevated to heavenly proportions
- Arugula wasn't overwhelming at all. Good punctuation
- Modest amount of cheese 
- With my brain I can focus and taste only the bun and meat if I wanted

- Sauce was good
- Literally would not change a thing about this burger

I was having a bad day and this burger rescued me into being happy again. Absolutely magical experience. What more can I ask of a burger? 10/10.
