# Domain name for the new website
#publish 
I've been nonplussed by "warrenpartridge.me" for a while now.

## Pain points of warrenpartridge.me
1) Too long for my taste.
	1) Subdomains like "art." make it even longer, which is an obstacle to [[Publishing this vault]].
	2) Setting up an email would be gross. "warren@warrenpartridge.me" :(
2) Tricky to communicate verbally since "Partridge" isn't easy to spell.
3) Zero relationship to my email domain, perdix.org.
4) Too formal-sounding.
5) Pretty sure it's registered under my student email with Namecheap.

## Misc ideas for a new one
1) x.partridge -- .com, me, etc -- these are all taken
2) x.partrid.ge -- .ge isn't a real [[Top-level domain|TLD]]
3) x.wpartridge.com -- not very cool and doesn't solve most of the pain points
4) x.perdix.me -- eh, idk
5) Something fancy with Latin...

The genitive case in Latin indicates ownership, e.g. "GENITIVE_NOUN's SUBJECT_NOUN" or "SUBJECT_NOUN of GENITIVE_NOUN." So, with the right cool-sounding genitive noun to use as a domain, I can grammatically imply ownership via "art.GENITIVE_NOUN.com". Pretty nifty.

My Latin is rusty but I _think_ a similar meaning could be stretched if I use the albative case. So...

5a) x.perdicis.com / x.perdice.com ("partridge")
5b) x.leporarii.com / x.leporario.com ("warren", translated rather liberally from ancient French "garenne")
5c) x.lupo.com / x.lupi.com ("rabbit" which is sorta related to "warren." But no way I'm getting this domain lol)
5d) x.ludo.com / x.ludi.com ("game" which I think sounds neat but there's no way I get the domain)

6) Something related to the etymology of "warren" which comes from "garenne" / "warenna" (old French / Latin) meaning "enclosed area often inhabited by game."

## Graveyard of other ideas

Nonexistent TLDs:
- Perdi.ce
- Perd.ix

"cogitationes avem" -- a bird's thoughts

With piglatin:
- perdix -> erdixpay
- perdice -> erdicepay
- perdicis -> erdicispay

## Decision?
Definitely perdicis.com. I like it even more than partridge.com. [[Perdicis etymology]]

And so [[Perdicis website]] is born!!
