_Metrics used by [[Best boba orders]] and [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

I figure it would be good to document my rough criteria for an X/10 rating.

- 10: Amazing. Like Anton Ego having his icy cold heart warmed by ratatouille tier-good.
- 9 and above: Exceptionally good. I'll go out of my way to recommend this to others.
- 8 and above: Very good. I'll actively seek this out for my next meal/snack.
- 7 and above: Good. A notch above the baseline expectations for a food category I'm familiar with.
- 6 and above: Decent. Nothing to write home about. I wouldn't seek this out unless a friend wanted to try it or there weren't other options nearby.
- 5 and below: A little bit below decent. Also nothing to write home about. Could be described as "ehh, not that good."
- 4 and below: Bad. I didn't enjoy finishing this. 
- 3 and below: Terrible. I'll only finish this if I'm hungry, being polite, or want to get value out of what I paid for it.
- 2 and below: Legitimately inedible. I probably didn't finish eating whatever this was.
- 1 and below: Reserved for cosmic horrors beyond my present comprehension.
