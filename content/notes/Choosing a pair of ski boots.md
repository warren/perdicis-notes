Notes from my investigation into ski boots...
- Don't fall for the aggressive dudes in stores trying to make a sale. A hawkish guy at Surefoot tried to pressure me into a boot I'd later learn was bad for my foot, because Surefoot doesn't carry the right boot.
- If you're an aggressive skier you'll want 4 buckles.
- Ski boots have a prominent number on them indicating their weight stress limit. Based on your weight this will determine which boots are compatible for you.
- There's a difference between a shell and a liner. Both can be heat-fitted but typically you won't need that unless you have a bizarre foot shape (I do[^1]). Not sure if true but Reddit says it's not worth it to heat mold your liners before you've had some time to break them in first and confirm you need that.
- The reason so many boot brands exist is that they have different proportions. For example the boot I'll probably get, Dalbellos or Atomics, is able to fit people like me with a high arch, narrow ankle, and wide front (see [[Body measurements]]).
