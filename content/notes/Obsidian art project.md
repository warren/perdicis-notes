# Obsidian art project
#publish
Opened [[2023-07-08]] but I originally had the idea [[2023-02-06]].
Related to [[Publishing this vault]] and [[My Obsidian setup]].

I'd like to make a physical manifestation of my Obsidian vault. At the time of writing I envision a framed art piece. Obsidian's graph view probably works well with that idea.

## Clusters of ideas

- Daily Journal
    - Maybe color differently based on the year? 2022/2023/2024/...
        - Alternatively: Use [[Residence history]] to mark the segments of my life where I lived in different places?

## Stuff I tried / insights
### First try

![[obsidian_art_firsttry.png]]

No need to use nested directories for colors (although that may a system worth adopting separately); regex works just fine.

Granular colors will need granular tagging though. Hm.

### Reddit post
I made a [Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1510fuz/ideas_for_making_graph_view_look_nice_for_a/) about this. Nothing useful in the comments :/

### Dad's suggestions from [[2023-07-16]]
- Laser-engraved plexiglass + crayon idea
    - Engraving holds the crayon color quite well
        - However would need to commit to non-gradient crayon colors
    - Could do a layer of plexiglass per year
    - Pinocco cuts plexiglass and engrave it

- Backlight panels
    - Could backlight?

- Lithophane idea
    - Relatively cheap
