I love this song. It's on both my workout and main playlist.

The song is ostensibly about heartbreak with an overarching theme of a clock (hence the title "whirring"). Plus several lyrics have double meanings:

- "Watch these hands move apart" -> (1) human hands moving apart after a breakup; (2) clock hands moving apart as time ticks too late
- "All these things about me you never can tell" -> (1) literally, you can't tell anyone these things because they're irrelevant with the relationship gone; (2) there are things about me you'll never know the truth about
