_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Fast food chain. Visited on [[2022-07-05]] for lunch.

Ingredients-wise, totally unremarkable. The standard burger comprised double 1/4lb patties, tomato, onion, lettuce, and a sesame bun. Also some mayo/house sauce mixed in. I forget if I chose this voluntarily, but

The patties were effectively cooked like smash burger patties. There's barely any rose color in the cross-section.

The ketchup on tap was noticeably good! It was a middle ground with some texture that was between Heinz and Sir Kensington - closer to the latter than the former. This alone bumped the rating up like 0.5-1 pt. I'll set my final rating to a 7. It's quite good for a fast food burger. But I wouldn't seek it out to eat.

The unfortunate part is that this was clearly a fast food burger which meant it was incredibly greasy. My hands were drenched afterwards and the bottom bun was soggy the whole time I ate. That's the main thing I didn't like but I think it's unchangeable given how they cook their patties and arrange ingredients.

The cost was $11 ($10 without cheese) and didn't come with fries.
