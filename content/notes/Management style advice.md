Opened [[2023-11-02]]. Dunno if this will be a fruitful article. If I open this many months later with no progress, just move this stuff back into that journal entry:

Micah: "Sounds good, please escalate to me if you're not seeing the progress you expect / you're blocked"

"For context, my way of nudging people on things like that where they're helping out is to say thanks for sharing expertise first so that they know I'm aware and I think it's important they help"

^ good advice.
