_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Plant-based burger place inside SFO airport terminal 1. I visited on [[2022-07-07]].

I got the Amy's burger, which is a double veggie patty with the standard fix-ins for a burger.

It was surprisingly good for a veggie burger. Medium levels of greasiness. $10, fries not included.

In retrospect, I was starving the day I ate and rated this. So while I initially gave it a 7.5/10, that's likely too high based on [[My food rating system]]. I've bumped it down to a 6.5.
