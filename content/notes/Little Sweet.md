Boba store in Union Square. It's King's favorite boba place in SF. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Iron Buddha (Tie Guan Yin whole milk tea) // 25% sweet // boba
3.5/10. But it might be partly my fault.

The milk tea tasted borderline bitter. I guess I should have gotten it sweeter, but I thought between the boba and the natural lactose it would barely need sweetening. The milk texture was also watery; I partly wonder whether the staff mixed up soy milk with whole milk. 

The boba was normal and they served a great amount of it.

I think I should give this place another shot.
