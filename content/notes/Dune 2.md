Watched this [[2024-03-15]] in 70mm IMAX.

## Summary
- skipping this section
- ... I can't believe they had the nerve to make this a trilogy and not warn us beforehand

## My thoughts
_Notes from when I was watching... I couldn't resist_

- small inconsistencies:
    - why not wear suit at night if you're sweating so much
    - "you've been exposed to spice for a while it creates weird dreams" but wait that's your whole life how do you know that
    - the tattoos on the old lady were faded and blurry (nice) but so were the ones on Paul's mother
    - why guy riding worm not wearing ski goggles and fine? Paul needed ski goggles
    - Dave Bautista being in a sandaroem and not wearing a helmet makes no sense lol
    - why the fuck doesn't everyone use guns 
    - "let him try" voice. Is that not breaking the rules of how the voice works for Hollywood
    - why are they all traveling south via worm TOGETHER? Would make it very easy to be spotted by the harkonnens no
- experiencing the thumps in surround sound is nice
- why is Zendaya allowed to sleep next to the Messiah
- a lot of the aesthetics here are very pure. Everyone has perfect skin and monocolor clothing.
- why is Paul so edgy. Does he want revenge (and become prophet) or not (be normal guy). Decide
- Dave Bautista killing guys he doesn't like mid flight is stupid and kinda breaks immersion
- wait how do they know the name of the prophet mouse
- "x character name? No way! He's crazy!" Exposition in general here kinda sucks
    - "galactic journal year1000. No news from south arrakis. Btw south arrakis has 1000 mile sandstorms and the lands are barren and no one lives there without faith. like what
- Vladimir harkonnen? Is that in the book?
- I like the world's building of the large steucturs
- how do they make everything look black and white still look like it has color? Looks cool
- the way the evil teen looks like a skull is cool
- not a fan of the kissing on the lips feels like anti gay
- lmao. "You are a foreigner". There it is, the second act breakup. And what's the business about not being on board with war. Isn't this what the fremen wanted
- artreides symbol is an eagle. That makes it easy to see who the good guys are I guess
- the scene where he blows up the rock is hilarious wtf lol.
    - I feel like a lot of stuff happens because the plot says it should not becauzs it makes sense. Like "new guy comes to arrakis and he's better than the last. How? Unclear. But he instantly found the home of the fremen and blrw them up"
    - and then Zendaya witnesses a fucking miracle but still yells the prophecy is false (fair, but can the movie explain why she still feels that way pls? Feels like it's happening bc book says so)
- bro just explain why you can't go south. 
- "you will never lose me. Not as long as you stay who you are." I feel like this could have been a better line
- cool that all the sand scenes must be done in one take. Really sells the authenticity
- "tell the baron the north is liberated." Was this the only fremen settlement protecting the entire northern hemisphere of arrakis
- why did he say at the end he was duke house afreides
- why no guns at the end??
- and yeah you can even tell they have shields so why harkonnen no win
- it's crazy how scary the no eyebrows look is in low light and how moronic it looks in even light
- ending mic drop by the bad guy including "in other words: your father is weak". Jesus who writes this
