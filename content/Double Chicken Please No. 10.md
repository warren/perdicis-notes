_Some of the science that went into finding the proportions_

This is an alcohol-optional [[Cocktails|cocktail]] served at Double Chicken Please in NYC. I tried it on [[2024-08-18]].

The cocktail doesn't have a name, just "#10".

## Flavor profile
A lovely combo of mild tea flavors with a bite of acidity and a brilliant smoky aftertaste. I prefer the non-alcoholic version.

## How to make
_These are guesstimates since DCP doesn't reveal the actual ingredient list nor proportions. But I think I found it_

- 1 cup (decaf) oolong tea
- 1 tbsp winter melon syrup
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp alcohol:
    - alcohol-free mezcal. I adore the "Monday" brand
    - mezcal. This was tasty too
    - tequila, which is a cheaper option that is also agave-based. I didn't like this but I'm not a tequila fan.

Preparation:
- mix em all in a pot
