_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Hipstery sandwich/American place I visited on [[2022-06-06]].

Multiple locations; I went to the one in Yerba Buena that has 4.4/5 stars on Google Maps: https://maps.app.goo.gl/cw6XEHFQvVofwZGP8

Their burger was very interesting. Ingredients-wise it is totally unremarkable: white bun, single patty, lettuce, raw onion, tomato, and no sauce (although some mustard and tomato salsa(?) is provided on the side). It is literally the least greasy burger I've ever tasted. Which sounds good but it's not.

The burger was basically a 7/10 but I'm bumping it down to a 6.5 to provide some differentiation with existing reviews.

[[2022-09-17]]: Actually, after formalizing [[My food rating system|the rating system]], I'm moving this further down to a 6. I believe that's most accurate.

[[2022-12-28]]: I'm further bumping this down to a 5 to provide a better review spread. Furthermore I believe I've literally said the words "eh, it's not that good" to friends when describing The Grove's burger, which is precisely the quote from [[My food rating system]] for a 5-rated dish.
