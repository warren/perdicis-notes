_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Food truck in Spark Social I visited on [[2023-07-29]] before [[Park day]].

Being a food truck, they only do takeout, but I ate mine as fresh as it could possibly be.

The burger was $13, didn't come with fries (I don't think they make any) and was a welcome surprise. It does what SPRO does with their other foods: a unique twist on a classic. 7.5/10. I really liked it.

Unusualness factor of 1.75:
- Cheddar, lettuce, tomato, raw onion, brioche (+0)
- Pickles (+0.25, arguably a +0 but w/e)
- Smoked guava rum sauce (+1.5)

The unusualness factor is deceivingly low; this burger tasted unlike any other I've had. It was sweet and mildly spicy -- from the rum sauce -- and surprisingly vegetable-y. The vegetables are really the star of this show. You can see in the second pic the proportion of vegetables to meat is like 1.5:1. Honestly I dig that decision. The flavors harmonize well, particularly because the sandwich was pleasantly non-oily.

The main con here is that the patty was fully cooked through, with no pink to be found. Although I criticize, I do wonder whether it benefitted the overall sandwich to be less greasy.

Final score: 7.5, even though I can't definitively suggest anything that would have improved it. Maybe I'll revisit this place. For now, I'm just thrilled SPRO continues to deliver on the cool flavors I came to them for.
