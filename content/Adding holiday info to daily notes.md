# Adding holiday info to daily notes
#publish 
It might be cool if my daily notes had the holiday noted after the weekday. My whole purpose of adding the weekday was to provide some context on the general shape of day. Holidays could provide even more context.

Maybe I could add a raw text file of holiday dates and write some Templater JavaScript snippet that pulls from it.

[[2022-04-26]]: I feel like if I did this, the plaintext is really the right thing to do. Or more likely, some JavaScript magic to compute an arbitrary holiday presence based on a date. Surely that's been done before and I just need to port it...
