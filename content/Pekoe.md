Boba store really close to 257 Arriba Dr.. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### CoolCumber // 0% sugar // No added toppings
8.5/10.

Hard to rate, honestly. I'd rate this 9/10 for healthy boba; 8.25 otherwise.

I forgot to get a topping so the only texture was the basil seeds... actually quite pleasant but I would have preferred something to chew on.

I could _taste_ the caffeine in this lol.

### CoolCumber // 0% sugar // Aloe vera
8.75/10.

Same as the above drink but with aloe vera. It did bump up my rating.

9.25/10 healthy; 8.5/10 otherwise. The aloe vera was tasteless. I still liked its texture.
