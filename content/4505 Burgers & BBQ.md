_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Outdoor patio-only BBQ restaurant that I visited with Sharon on [[2022-06-08]].

Note: this review is for the 1/2lb burger which is a double patty. I had the single patty 1/4lb in the past when Cari visited before I started my burger tier list but I recall it being rather unremarkable.

Ingredients were mostly standard - no tomato, just lettuce and onion. The bun was unusually full of sesame seeds (even more so in the restaurant's Google Maps pics) so I'm rating it a 0.25/10 for unusualness.

I felt it was the correct amount of oily - enough to provide flavor but not so much that the burger is drenched and falling apart, like McDonald's or [[The Melt]].

I rated it a 9/10 overall. Which is higher than [[Miller and Lux]] - and I think I stand by my rating of that. In both restaurants I felt full enough to not want another burger but here I felt I wouldn't feel as disgusted with myself should I hypothetically eat another.

In summary: a 9/10 overall rating and 0.5/10 unusualness factor lands this burger pretty close to my platonic ideal. :)

Doesn't come with fries. But that's not part of the criteria!
