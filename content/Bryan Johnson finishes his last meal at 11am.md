> In a 2020 post on Medium titled "I fired myself" Johnson wrote that he was regularly binging on carbs and sugar between 5 to 10 p.m. "Evening Bryan," as Johnson called his alter ego in the post, "overate and gained more than fifty pounds, fueling relentless shame, guilt and malaise." 
> Johnson wrote that this behavior had repercussions on his mood, sleep, and performance. "In short, Evening Bryan was making life miserable for all Bryans," he wrote. 
> "So, a year ago, I fired Evening Bryan from his shift, revoking his authority to make food consumption decisions." Since then only "Morning Bryan" is authorized to make decisions on when, what, and how much to eat, Johnson wrote. 

How fascinating. This guy experiences the werewolf too, and he's leveraged the idea of taming it as his personal brand. Bryan's solution is basically an extreme version of my cold turkey/Type A solution.

I know he has a son but I wonder whether he's married. I worry at times my brain is prickly to get along with due to this.
