Opened [[2024-06-02]].

I'm going to [[Publishing this vault|publish Waulter]] soon and open my brain to the internet. When I do, it would be nice to consolidate a meta page of pages other people might enjoy reading. Maybe that's you, and that's this?

## Meta pages (pages of pages)
- [[Musings]] (Meta-meta page)
    - [[Musings on philosophy]]
    - [[Musings on tech]]
    - [[Musings on everything else]]
- [[Articles I like]]
- [[My tech setups]]
- [[Resources for readers]]

## Pages I'm fond of
- [[The best burger in the bay area]]
- [[Perdicis etymology]]
- [[The cosmic computer]]

## Misc pages that friends might enjoy leafing through
- [[The internet game decathlon]]
- [[Movies I've seen]]
- [[Skincare]]

## Just for funsies
- [[Taylor Swift to trap pipeline]]
- [[Portuguese Man of War]]


## Appendix
Honestly, this list is so incomplete. A fun way to discover more pages is slamming the "Random article" button. Idk how to link that here easily so I'll put it in the 404 page, which you can reach by typing nonsense into your browser bar after the forward slash, like `notes.perdicis.com/Nonsense`
