Neat factoids:
- Modern science suggests that body twitches are not triggered by the brain and received by the body but the reverse: we twitch as a calibration mechanism by which our brain can better sense the body.
    - Supporting evidence: rat pups whose eyes aren't developed enough to have never seen anything still twitch their eyes
    - Also, electrical impulses in the brain occur after body twitches.
- People with schizophrenia are capable of tickling themselves because they cannot distinguish self from other.
    - Dreamers are the same way; if you wake someone during REM sleep, they too can tickle themselves as they come awake, presumably because they can't distinguish self from other.
- REM sleepers can't (easily) have their dreams influenced (the article doesn't really elaborate on this)
    - But tests were run on sleepers where they're exposed to scents and even sights -- they pull their eyes open -- and the sleepers' dreams didn't react accordingly
