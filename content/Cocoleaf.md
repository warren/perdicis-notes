# Cocoleaf

Boba store in Boston on Newbury St.. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Jasmine green tea // 0% sugar // Lychee jelly
7.25/10. Great.

This is the first boba order I ever added to [[Best boba orders]]. Retroactively, I adjusted the score 8->7.25. To be clear though, I think Cocoleaf is one of the better places to get boba in Boston, and a different drink from their shop might score higher.
