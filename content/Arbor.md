_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Bar and grill near my place in Hayes Valley. It's 1 block away from [[Chez Maman]]. Visited here [[2024-09-05]] in my post-[[Burning Man]] travails.

TL;DR: Nothing special burger. The patio is lovely, though.

_The burger (5/10 tasty)_

_The backyard patio (9/10 cozy)_

Justification for the burger rating:
- Basically average overall, leaning below average -- hence 5/10 as per [[My food rating system]].
- Pros:
    - Meat cooked correctly and nicely. It was indeed medium rare
- Cons:
    - Untoasted, cold bun
    - Cheese hard to taste bc extremely thin. It seemed less than a standard cold-cut slice of cheddar from the grocery store
    - The proportions felt wrong for everything. There was not quite enough meat (1/3 lb) relative to:
        - Enormous amount of bun. It was 2-2.5x the size of the burger uncompressed.
        - Enormous amount of lettuce
        - Tiny amount of cheese
        - High amount of meat juice

So overall rating 5/10, aka barely below average. It's held back a lot by the bun. I wouldn't make a specific visit to this place if I had a choice. Especially since [[Chez Maman]] is literally right next door, serving a 7/10 burger.

Oh and $17 price, fries not included.

Unusualness factor is 0.5. Calculation:
- Normal (+0)
    - Bun
    - Beef
    - Cheddar
    - Tomato
    - Lettuce
    - House sauce
- Unusual-ish (+0.25 each)
    - Caramelized onions (did I even taste them?)
