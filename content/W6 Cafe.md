_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

The 6th floor cafe of 345 Spear St.. In the year+ I'd worked here I hadn't seen a burger, but today ([[2023-05-26]]) was the day I'll finally try a Google burger.

2/10. Disgraceful.

The cost was $0. Yeah, including fries. But some things you don't pay for with money.

Unusualness calculator:
- Top bun (+0)
- Some cheese (+0)
- A very small burger patty (+0)
- Bottom bun (+0)

In all seriousness this is somehow far worse than I could make myself at a BBQ with only Costco ingredients. It's even worse than [[Causwell's]]. I didn't finish eating the whole thing.

Specifically, the bread was cold, the meat was thoroughly overcooked to a leathery texture, and the cheese was barely tasteable.

I think if this came without cheese I'd give it at 1.25. Or a 1.5 if it came with American cheese.

Update ((DATE SOMETIME IN MID 2024)): Turns out this burger is typically served with accoutrements (lettuce, tomato, onions) that weren't around that day. Maybe I got to the cafeteria late last year? But, basically, I rated an unfurnished burger. I'll have to rerate it if it comes back.
