Backlink: [[Musings on politics]]. Related to [[Stable diffusion fraud]].

Todo: a better title. At a minimum this needs to be a section on AI, maybe even a separate article shard.

this was posted on Reddit today and I found it notable: https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/wxqxj0/ai_is_getting_a_little_too_realistic
- This is a fake video.
- Thought-provoking comment: "Is it worth the views to undermine people's media literacy?"
  - The internet is a race to the bottom...


 
Date unknown but before the TikTok thing: heard a notable comment from a googler Bryant Gibson (paraphrased): "Very curious the effect of widespread generative art will have on novelty of artistic styles. As Diffusion, Transformers, etc look backwards, you could easily see art intentionally moving away from easily generated directions into thoroughly unexpected directions (similar to how things like constructivism arose from the ubiquity of photography)"
