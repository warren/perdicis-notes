# Taylor Swift to trap pipeline

#needswork: Unwall this garden
Opened around, like, [[2024-08-22]]. I forget when I first thought of this.

Anyways my thought is that there's 3 songs that encapsulate the hero's journey into the depths of liking trap.

1) [Anti-Hero // Taylor Swift](https://open.spotify.com/track/0V3wPSX9ygBnCm8psDIegu?si=23c5d753a7674e3e)
    - Catchy.
    - Inoffensive.
    - Good song.
    - I rang in 2023's New Year listening to this.
2) [Anti-Hero - ILLENIUM remix // Taylor Swift, ILLENIUM](https://open.spotify.com/track/6C0H8ts9M6deezz0yYR6LK?si=9cd42e5651af4902)
    - Catchy.
    - Inoffensive, provided you're not a diehard TSwift fan.
    - Largely unchanged from the original.
        - Adds standard pop EDM instrumental hook atop the hook @ 1m35s
    - If you enjoy this, you might like other pop EDM.
1) [STFU // Crankdat](https://open.spotify.com/track/0v1nobrUSVLIXrYaI4zwkw?si=10e43242a1a34c9c)
    - **Incomprehensible** to anyone who doesn't listen to trap.
    - **Comprehensible** after listeners have reached stage 2 of the pipeline.
    - **Actively enjoyable** at stage 3.
    - Just listen to the first 20 seconds.

I made a Spotify playlist of these 3 songs for easy access: [click me](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4sFN9grxrxoqXDVR5W4sS8)
