# AI art and human obsolescence

_Hitler was also an artist before he was a megalomaniac._

Part of [[Musings on philosophy]]; related to [[The human knowledge horizon]].

Musings dated [[2023-05-06]]. I wonder if my predictions will be proven accurate.

AI art is solid cocktail conversation topic these days because anyone can weigh in. Those sympathetic to artists muse sourly over the ethical implications of training AIs without permission. The technically- and economically-minded discuss the current cost of a teraflop. In the corner, zoomers and philosophers take shots.

Part of what makes the topic so fun is that largely, everyone already agrees. Stealing is bad, AIs who are more competent than humans are scary, and capitalism is probably going to fumble this one up bad. In general it seems people believe this situation is a universally negative one, and that AI art will be disastrous.

### My opinion
I want to document a contrarian take, that AI art is a force for net good. It will (1) allow the world to produce a greater quantity of art, (2) spur the average person to train a more critical eye when interpreting art, and (3) have a net zero or net positive effect at lowering the barrier for individuals to produce meaningful art.

### 1) AI artists will mean a greater quantity of art
This is for certain. It's already tough to distinguish some AI art from real art (see [[Stable diffusion fraud]] for my experience with that). Sure, quality is subjective, but that AI art shares the same believability ballpark with human art convinces me it's on par with most subjective experiences of art.

### 2) Which means people will train a more critical eye
With one's senses flooded by generated (and retouched) art, the only way to cope is to find a way to mentally filter though it all. Perhaps I'm projecting but I think often people don't ponder whether they _actually_ like a piece of art. The result of this is, under the right circumstances (e.g. visiting an overhyped museum exhibit), people can convince themselves they are a fan of virtually any kind of art. Exclusivity fuels pointless hype trains.

So AI art is sort of a meritocratizing force. We'll eventually get to a point where teraflops are cheap enough and pretrained models are accessible enough that pretty much anyone with a good idea can generate art. The most visionary artists will probably inpaint or retouch their work using AI. In that sense, stable diffusion is basically a hyper-advanced paintbrush. You can let your robo-paintbrush totally loose and allow it to handle (basically) the creation of your whole art piece, or you can use it with intent.

I think AI art powered by human intent will start winning out over generic AI art pretty soon.

### 3) And for those seeking to create great art, the barrier to entry will either lower or remain unchanged
The robo-paintbrush becoming universally accessible means anyone with an idea can produce art. I suspect the effect of this will be either (A) lots more art in general -- including perceptibly generic and bad art -- is produced, or (B) more art is produced and it is in general of a higher quality.

There's probably some variance in opinion on whether (A) or (B) is more likely. It'll depend on what you consider "good" art (a whole article topic on its own). I'm torn on this topic because I suspect AI artists will result in a ton of generic art flooding the internet. Is generic == bad? Right now I feel the answer is "no," but maybe I'll change my mind.

Anyways, I think with the barrier lowered, we'll start seeing more art and therefore more great art.

## Appendix
I glossed over some huge topics that usually come up in cocktail conversation so I'll try to cover them here since they're interesting.

### The churn of art culture may accelerate
From a conversation with Christie:
> Hot take but I think in terms of art created it will be close to a net good

> True creativity these days already comes from people purposefully breaking the mold and doing something funky w it

> Ai art will become the new mold, everyone's gonna use it as a blueprint for their drawings

> Then the drawings will all look samey

> Then someone will break the mold

> Then the mold will change

> Repeat

> Maybe, like, the cycle of art culture will accelerate

> But that's all I think

### Capitalism's reaction to AI art might be scary
The idea that a team of environment artists on a cartoon might shrink to 20% of its size is spooky. Netflix already tried this and credited an AI artist in their credits to serious backlash, but I doubt the negative sentiment will last.

I'm fortunate and grateful that my income isn't from art so I'm not threatened. This lack of threat surely influences my view on AI art being good, too.


### The problem of operator deficiency
> I saw a meme post about how artists shouldn't be worried about being replaced because people can't communicate what they want to the AI and I LOL'd

This is pretty true imo. The job of a stable diffusion model is to extrapolate words (a frickin tiny dimensional space) into a whole image (frickin huge dimensional space). There's so much room for randomness that the best models are differentiated by their method of effectively injecting randomness.

Like the whole thing is so chaotic. Surely there will exist a tool in the future that's more effective than words in the future, an Adobe Photoshop of Al art, with dials and knobs like "lock alpha layer" that will do something funky with the image.


### More thoughts
[[2023-06-06]]: https://reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/141hg9x/controlnet_for_qr_code feels like an evolution of art. This is a new thing altogether that relies on human creativity yet uses the new tools.

[[2023-09-05]]:
More on AI art as a meritocratic force. I think anyone being able to create art means we'll see a greater diversity of perspectives.

"The old masters" were masters of their craft because virtually nobody had the time or economic privilege to spend time learning art. So while that period produced beautiful art, it was an echo chamber.

Individual artists came next, pushing forward weird movements like impressionism that was resisted at the time but eventually appreciated.

Between then and now, art has become increasingly accessible. AI will make it even more so.
