_Part of a series on [[Attractions per city]]._

## Food
- Peppermill, it's a kitschy brunch place. Huge lines tho.
- Chanko Shabu & Izakaya. Monumentally great food and great decoration. Went here [[2023-03-18]]
- Wicked Spoon buffet.
    - Apparently everyone loves the crab legs here but I don't get the hype
