_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Mom and dad's favorite California diner. I visited their Sunnyvale location on [[2022-12-26]].

It's hard to discern from the photo but the burger patty was a straight hockey puck shape. I.e. it wasn't made from ground beef.

The (cold) bun to meat ratio was something like 3-4:1 and the fillings were of the consistency you'd get from a Subway. They had sauteed mushrooms and mayo though which was nice (the mushrooms earn this a 0.5 unusualness factor). Overall a pretty boring burger that's definitely below average; I could make a better tasting one on a grill (does that say more about Hobee's or me?).

Though not a factor in the rating, the burger came with hash browns that were basically just cold diced potatoes. I didn't touch them.

4.5/10.
