That song by Illenium. It gives me vivid imagery for some reason:
- Girl stands in the rain on a bridge in a city. Low color.
- 0:43: "Say something different" -- an airplane's trail flashes in color; eyeblink flashback to sitting on a plane with her ex
- 1:07: Colored ghosts push out of her, overlapping and yelling muted
- Her eyes widen. She starts running, tears rapidly forming in her eyes
    - Low angle shot of her shoes splashing in a puddle, gaining speed
    - More and more ghosts
- 1:15: She jumps down a short flight of stairs as a shortcut
- 1:18: Lands in a puddle at the bottom _but falls straight through to the other side_
    - Blast of overwhelming color
    - Ghosts fully manifest, shouting
    - Floating drops of water (blurry: rainwater? or tears)
- 1:44: Cut back to reality. She is walking, her jacket soaked in muddy water.
