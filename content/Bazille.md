It's inside a Nordstrom, who apparently operates it as one of several store exclusive restaurants in _tons_ of locations.

Burger is exactly what you'd expect a Cheesecake Factory burger to be like. 0/10 interesting and meh 6/10 quality.

Unrelated to the menu: the overall service and restaurant was great. Not too many people around and a neat rooftop view down onto Market Street. My expectations were nonexistent going in yet I found myself pleasantly surprised. Maybe this is the key to happiness in life. Eating at Nordstrom. I bumped up the rating 1/4 of a point for this alone.

We got cute complimentary mint chocolate sticks at the end of the meal.

Burger was $16 and comes with fries.
