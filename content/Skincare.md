# New routine (circa ~[[2024-02-15]])
I have combination skin type leaning oily btw. YMMV

This system is the perfect balance of effective and simple enough for me to stick to on a routine.

**Morning**
1) CeraVe foaming facial cleanser
2) Skin Aqua UV super moisture gel sunscreen

That provides enough moisture for the day. The sunscreen works as lotion for me and I like how it dries light and airy.

**Evening**
1) CeraVe foaming facial cleanser again
2) (Optional, only do this as needed like once per 2 months) The Ordinary Peeling Solution 30% AHA + 2% BHA
3) Haruharu black rice hyaluronic acid toner
4) Facial lotion of some kind. I use a green tea gel moisturizer - emphasis on the "gel" because my oily combination skin reacts better to alcohol-based products. I used the ordinary natural moisturizing factors for a while and swapped to a green tea facial moisturizer that was cheaper and scentless.

**Misc notes**
- I (update: used to!) keep an extra CeraVe hydrating facial cleanser around so that when I'm feeling lazy I'll replace the foaming cleanser with the hydrating cleanser for dry skin types. Then I will skip moisturizing because that cleanser basically doubles as lotion.
    - Update from late Feb/early March: this is no longer needed (and actually strictly worse than my new solution) because I discovered a gel moisturizer. I just use the foaming cleanser for oily skin now and moisturize via alcohol based lotion which my skin prefers.
- I also have that cute Korean scrub glove, the green and pink brand, to do physical exfoliation every once and a while in the shower. I'm really light with it. I use green for body and pink for face so the two don't mix. More on this in the misc notes section.

## Fun acronyms
- **AHAs**: Alpha Hydroxl Acids.
	- Used for exfoliating the top layer of your skin.
	- It basically chemical-burns off the top layer of dead skin on your face.
	- You feel dry afterwards.
	- **Note**: Wear AT LEAST SPF 30 sunscreen for 24hrs after using this. Your skin is a lot more fragile afterwards.
	- This is not great for people with sensitive skin.
	- Common acids: glycolic, lactic, mandelic.
- **BHAs**: Beta Hydroxl Acids.
	- Used for exfoliating deeper layers of your skin.
	- BHAs are salicylic acid-based, which is oil-soluble.
	- Being oil-soluble means BHAs can slip past the oils in your pores to get deeper into your skin, chemically dissolving dead cells and grime underneath your pores.
	- Sunscreen is still necessary.
	- You can use both AHA and BHA exfoliants at once but be careful. Chemical skin damage is bad.

## Theories?
My skin might be dehydrated because I overwash it. If that's true, the way to fix this is:
- No exfoliation.
- Gentle, low-pH cleansers.
- Pair a gentle, water-based hydrating toner or serum with a cream to lock in the moisture.

## Misc notes
Other people add toners/serums between steps 2-3 in my routine. Toners/serums are additive chemicals that are effective at treating specific skin issues (e.g. uneven pigment discoloration, acne, etc.).

The sidebar on /r/skincareaddiction is incredibly helpful for getting a balanced picture of the products out there.

There's this cute scrub glove thing that's popular in Korea these days. It's a cheap tool for physical exfoliation. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GCHR39G/ref=sw_img_1?smid=A2ELKFD9U58CKY&psc=1
