Related to [[Musings on philosophy]].

This is episode #295 of Making Sense. I listened to it while [[Cutting my own hair]] on [[2023-09-15]].

## Summary
- Sam Harris talks to Kieran Setiya, an MIT philosophy professor, about moral ethics.
- Sam drags the topic back to existentialism a lot, and rambles, but I don't mind it much.

## What stuck with me
- The idea of [[Telic and atelic activities]].
	- "Engaging with them shouldn't extinguish them" -- on atelic activities
	- We should have both kinds of goals.
- Reducing someone to an object of observation is one of the most uncomfortable things to do to someone.
	- Maybe the root of all uncomfortableness?
	- The best friendships are those where you don't have to constantly ponder the perception of you in their eyes
		- Wow that connected some neurons in my brain writing that; added to [[Philosophy on dating]]
