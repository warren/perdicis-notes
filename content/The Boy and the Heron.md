Watched this subbed [[2023-12-07]] in the Japantown Kabuki 8.

## Themes I noticed
- The boy fearing nature (birds, foliage, caves) and taking solace in urban cities
- Heavy overarching theme of war
    - Birds being evil probably parallels fighter jets, esp. as the father is an industrialist who owns a factory for them
    - Original Japanese name for the movie, "How do you live?", rooted in a wartime book Miyazaki read
- Groupthink is made scary. Even benign creatures like pelicans and parakeets appear nightmarish when moving as a single ravenous herd
    - Father character
- Theme of opposites
    - boy is terrified by fire irl; enters an ocean world -- his doppelganger wields fire confidently as a weapon

## Open questions
- Is himi the mom or not? What's up with her entering a "world" door with the intent to birth the boy and later die in the hospital?
- What do the blocks represent? And what changed between the boy's opinion of them being tainted in his vision vs being clean when he finally sees them in person?
