Required
- 2oz tequila
- 0.5oz triple sec (orange liqueur)
- 1oz lime juice
- 0.5oz agave syrup OR simple syrup
    - This is a bit more complicated; agave syrup is heavier and more caramel-y.
    - Agave nectar supposedly helps to push the tequila flavor to the forefront, since it's essentially the same product used to make tequila, and is a different type of sugar altogether from cane.
- (Optional) Salt rim / lime wheel garnish

Cointreau is also a potential ingredient but that's for more experts.


1. Add tequila, orange liqueur, lime juice and agave syrup to a cocktail shaker filled with ice, and shake until well-chilled.
    
2. Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.
    
3. Garnish with a lime wheel and kosher salt rim (optional).
