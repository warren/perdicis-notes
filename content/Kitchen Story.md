_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Famous SF brunch place on [[Attractions in San Francisco]]. Went here [[2023-01-16]] with Lisa and Sharon.

Specifically, I got the burger called the New England Burger:
- Arugula (+0.5 unusualness)
- "Maple syrup" wagyu patty (+0.25? Forget if I tasted it)
- Bacon (+0.25)
- White cheddar (+0.25)

Total unusualness factor: 1.25
Rating: 7.5/10

Bun was much smaller than the burger itself

Lacking tomato but that's good, the acid would have overcome the savory flavor. Bacon pushes the savory flavor. Small amount of arugula

I typically hate non crispy bacon but here it was totally the right choice

Same level of savory as like a McDonald's burger without the sauces and with a thicker medium rare patty. This is a good thing.

Had a neat butter sauce thing that was sweet
