Opened [[2023-10-19]] in the context of planning [[2023 NYC trip]]. Dumped into [[Musings on everything else]].

This title is clickbait. Mom's advice is simple: **Avoid redeyes at all costs.**
## Day 1 advice, redeye or not: Get yourself to sleep when it's nighttime
Ideally no later than midnight local time. Force yourself to sleep by eating carbs in the evening right before you get into bed.

Related topic: **Sleep is heavily related to what you eat.**
- Carbs/sugars put you to sleep.
- Salads/protein on the first day wakes you up.

### Hypothetical advice for my NYC trip
Goal: Arrive in NYC at a time when I can plop my body into sleeping.
- I'll land 9pm EST (6pm PST)
    - 12am EST is when it's realistic to fall asleep.
    - Make sure to be disciplined to get up at 7am or whatever.
        - I'll drag a bit but I won't be totally dead.
        - Maybe Mom is biased here since she finds doing this easy.
    - Wake up, do something active.
