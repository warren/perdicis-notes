This title is a trick. Mom's real advice is: **Avoid redeyes at all costs.**

But if you must take a redeye, here's her other advice as a seasoned traveler:

## Day 1 advice
Whether you took a redeye or not: **Sleep when it's night time.** Ideally no later than midnight local time.

Tips for this:
- Eat carbs in the evening.

## Day 2 advice
Don't nap. Stay awake and leverage your tiredness to get to bed on time.

Tips for this:
- Eat something light to keep you awake. Remember:
    - Carbs/sugars put you to sleep.
    - Salads/protein wake you up.
- Do something active or exercise. Exercise wakes you up in the short term (good) and makes you tired in the long term (also good).

## Day N advice
Keep doing this till your sleep schedule is adjusted.
