Magical anti-hangover probiotic. I've been evangelizing this to my friends since roughly [[2023-05-01]].

## Notes on effectiveness
[[2023-05-06]]: Took Zbiotics before everything. I drank a degenerate amount (ballpark 8 drinks for my lightweight self) and was fine the next day.

[[2023-05-28]]: Dosed after ~45 min and 1.5 drinks. No hangover the next day.

[[2023-06-02]]: Dosed after 2 drinks and ~1.5 hours. I was decently sluggish the next day. I guess it doesn't work if you wait that long.

[[2023-06-03]]: Dosed after 1.25 drinks and ~1 hour in. No hangover symptoms the next day.

[[2023-07-15]]: Dosed before everything. No hangover at all the following day; I even got up at 8.

[[2023-10-15]]: Just noting here for completeness sake, I think I threw it all up lol but it probably would have worked otherwise.

[[2024-01-01]]: Totally didn't work. But I also drank zero water before passing out. So yeah this stuff isn't magic.

[[2024-02-04]]: Didn't like, not work, but I felt off the following morning. It seems only a few drinks trigger a mild hangover.

[[2024-02-24]]: Yeah I felt great the next day.
