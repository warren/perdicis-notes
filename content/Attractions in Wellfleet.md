sounds like a great time.

yeah when i hosted a lot of people (7) we kinda split into two groups for a few of the days and at the beginning of each day i'd lay out some possibilities. so some could bike to the breakwater / box lunch while others could chill at the beach or pond and sail/kayak. one day there was a shrooms group and an "active" group lol. but we'd also plan group wide stuff and always do dinner together. if you can, try to invite someone who likes to help with the cooking bc it can get to be a lot, tho i'm sure you guys can afford going out more than we could.

the usual fun list of activities i use is:
- pond stuff (swimming, raft, kayaking the raft out to the middle of the pond and maybe bringing drinks / lunch, sailing, skim boarding)
- beach stuff (white crest has a high dune which is very cool, duck harbor for sunset, bonfire permit for drinks and twilight beach. newcomb is good bc you can not be sober and still make it home)
- great island hike (+bike to it if you have a fit crowd. it's an out and back so you can go as far as you like. in the summer there are bugs tho which you can avoid by walking on the beach or bringing bug spray.)
- tennis, tho u may have to reserve courts. Mayo beach park (the skate park) also does free shakespeare performances and other community things at their gazebo 
- wellfleet galleries
- provincetown
(province lands bike trail which is the hilly dune trail u got your beard scar on, the monument which has gotten stupid expensive lately but parking there is $20 for the whole night, obviously bars and marine specialties and all the quirks of p town)
- trail runs around the kettle ponds 
- mini golf (literally every 5 miles on route 6)
- live music at a few places in wellesley (pearl, block and tackle, etc)
- Piping Plover dispensary on main st
- rail trail
- uncle tim's bridge
- the "we got games at home special" (drunk twister, murder,  other board games, TV has hdmi for switch)
- drive in theater! just saw barbie at it with alex. 
- PB's bakery
- box lunch
- flying fish cafe
