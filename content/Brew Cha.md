Boba store in SF. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### White grape oolong tea // 0% sugar // Crystal boba
4.5/10.

This one was hard to rate. It basically tasted like water with tasteless boba because there was genuinely no sugar added. Plus I guess grapes are watery. It tastes _healthy_ which I guess is alright but it's not something I would want to order again; hence a sub-5/10 rating.
