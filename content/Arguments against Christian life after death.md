One simple argument goes: suppose you love someone who isn't Christian. They won't go to heaven. What would your heaven be without them? Thought that was a novel argument.
- Specifically, Revelations 21:4's description of heaven includes "lack of pain". How can you be lacking pain if you lack someone you love?
