Review of https://psychedelic-information-theory.com/Entoptic-Hallucination

## Summary
Article uses a lot of jargon I'm unfamiliar with. Some key terms:

- Entoptic hallucinations: Originate from outside the eye (hence "ent-optic"). Somewhere between the eye and cortex.
    - These are like, hallucinations of geometry, kaleidoscope stuff, and fractal recursion.
- Eidetic hallucinations: Originate within the cortex and midbrain.
    - These are like, hallucinations of a childhood memory or friend.

Makes a lot of sense imo to distinguish between those types of hallucinations.

Physical pressure on the eyes/optical nerves drives entoptic hallucinations, but not eidetic hallucinations. "Hallucinations" are also known here as "phosphenes". The article covers 3 types:
- Pressure
- Flicker
- Kinetic (like when you bump your head -- seeing stars)

Flicker phosphenes can be induced by hallucinogens that trigger brain pulse activity(?) within certain wavelengths(?).
