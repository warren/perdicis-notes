Boba place north of GGP. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Peach Oolong tea // 0% sugar // boba
8.5/10. It's been a while since my last rating but I definitely think this is above average.

Boba has a pleasant texture and isn't too sweet. The tea itself tastes vaguely sweet; maybe that's just from the peach. So maybe this rating is cheating a little by being sweeter than 0%.

Got this drink on [[2024-07-06]].
