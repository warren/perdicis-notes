Lots to write about here.

SLO = Service Level Objective
- I.e. 

SLI = Service Level Indicator

SLA = Service Level Agreement

## healthiness in teams responding
- slow burn: ticket
- fast burn: page


## No SLO
If your service operates above its SLO threshold for a long period of time and then regresses -- customers generally notice. That old baseline _was_ your SLO.
