# Musings
#publish 

This is a meta page to link to my other musings.
- [[Musings on philosophy]]
- [[Musings on tech]]
- [[Musings on everything else]]
- [[Musings on politics]] (private)
- [[Musings on myself]] (private)

TODO: group these all under a note called [[Teaching to avoid learning]]

Generally speaking, websites I enjoy:
- msci.com
- pew research
- The ones I linked from within [[Rationalism]]
- idk it'll depend on the topic I need evidence for.
