## Drinks
### Matcha milk tea // 25% sugar // Default boba
9.25/10. This is the best boba I've had in months! As I write this, it's second-to-top on the tier list.

l even believe it might deserve a higher rating. It wasn't fully mixed when I drank it, so the first 2/3 of the drink was perfect followed by 1/3 of rather bitter matcha flavor. I still liked it.

Other things I liked that made it stand out:
- Boba was not very sweet. This is easily the best tapioca boba I've had in my life, without contest. The malted honey flavor is like an accent on the natural chewy tapioca texture - instead of the other way around, where typically the boba is just a sweet topping that's largely interchangeable with another sweet topping based on your mood. This is perfect and I would say essential to the drink.
- The drink isn't too sweet at 25%. It's perfect. Divine inspiration told me to pick 25% and it was the right call.
- It's so cheap! $4.50 for 16oz!

I would 100% come back here. Real hidden gem. The lady at the counter was nice too.

First got this drink on [[2022-11-05]].
