Quality-of-everyone's life idea: Make GPS more accurate in tunnels by convincing cities to store some hardware in their lightbulbs that can communicate with phones/satellites to give phones a better location read.

Also, do this for lightbulbs inside malls so people can actually use indoor maps to get step by step instructions.

If the market cap for the above isn't very high, consider making this into a device that people stick on storefronts to add their store to the AR metaverse somehow... idk. Metaverse is a buzzword right now.
