Boba store. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Honey lemon jasmine(?) tea // 0% sugar // Lychee jelly
9.5/10. Amazing wow do it again.

Only improvement would be the white pearls from [[Gong Cha]].

### (G2) Strawberry green tea // 0% sugar // Lychee jelly
6/10.

Surprisingly sweet. I guess strawberries are already naturally sweet.

Tasted great but a bit too sweet. Would be improved by substituting a less sweet topping than lychee jelly.
