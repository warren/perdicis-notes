### King
- Clean Merlin
- Fail first unless order issue
- Absolutely ruthless; has thrown a new player under the bus
- If making absurd statements late into the game, probably playing good and believes he has identified Merlin and is trying to cover
  - Will get noticeably heated when people don't listen at this point
- As good, will accuse Merlin of being evil to cover
- As Percival, will say "X can figure it out" to throw heat onto the wrong person.
- As Merlin, is ok asking Morgana to join teams. Reasoning is that he can later prove himself to be the good.


#### Milly
- Dirty Merlin
- Prefers Percival and assassin

#### Brian
- As evil, when threatened with being not picked, will try to logic out 

#### Roy
- Very chill
- As good, when threatened with not being picked, won't really fight it too hard but will self advocate in a chill tone

#### Sharon
- If playing dumb, evil

#### Marie
- If making eye contact and checking with individual people, probably evil or at least untrustworthy servant.

#### Yiwen
- Dirty Merlin

#### Kenneth
- As evil, typically interjects accusations or statements to be on the team.
- As good, even role card good, pretty quiet.

#### Marie
- Will run past timer and take a long time to decide regardless of playing good or evil.
- "How about you put my co-evil on the team?"
