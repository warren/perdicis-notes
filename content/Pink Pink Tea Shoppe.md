Boba store at the SF Westfield Mall. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

## Drinks
### Lapsang souchong black tea // 0% sugar // Lychee jelly // Tiramisu top
5/10.

It's one of those places that genuinely doesn't sweeten for 0%, which is fine except they added barely any lychee jelly. The flavor of the recommended tiramisu top clashed hard with the fruit tea flavor. Next time I would skip the cheese top altogether or at least get a normal cheese top instead of tiramisu.
