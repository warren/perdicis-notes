# Coin flips at work

_What will I work on today?_

Linked in [[Musings on everything else]] but idk whether it belongs here.

I've been noticing a recurring event at work that correlates with me feeling burnt out in the evenings. I'm calling this event "losing the coin flip" for now because I visualize the pattern like flipping a coin each day in the morning -- and if the coin lands on tails, something gigantic pops up at work that demands my full attention for most of the work day. On those days, I go to bed having done a lot of urgent, sprung-on-you-last-minute type work; but it doesn't feel like I made progress on anything that matters.

(The coin flip isn't really 50-50 odds; it's more like 1 in 20, so I guess this is a weighted coin.)

A more formal definition might be: "a disruption of agency at work caused an unpredictable event that significantly disrupts my plans."

Or more succinctly: "a sudden lack of agency at work."

It's not fun.

**Note from future Warren 2 years later:**
This was certainly a real phenomenon in my life, and I think I was too young in my career to realize it's simply operational overload. [[2022-03-23 - Life after 2022-03-23|Life after 2022-03-23]] fixed it
