_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Restaurant in Rincon Hill I visited with Kenneth on [[2023-12-18]] after work.

The restaurant itself was brightly lit and intricately decorated in a classy-kitschy type way. I hope they have good drinks because the burger was a really disappointing 3/10. It was $19 with fries.

The rudimentary issue is I'm pretty sure I could make a better burger myself with zero prep or experience. The meat was indeed cooked medium rare which was great. But the bun was cold and looked like (or just was?) a generic Costco bun. All the vegetables toppings were raw and refrigerator-cold.

So yeah 3/10. I'm super disappointed because I've been wanting to come here a while. Maybe the menu changed and this is a one-off? The menu tonight called this a "Bomb burger" or something to that tune, while online I can only find references to "Fly trap burger". Oh well.

Unusualness calculation: 0/10
- (Sadly) normal bun
- Normal meat patty
- Raw lettuce, onion, and tomato
