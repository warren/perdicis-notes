_Part of a series on [[The best burger in the bay area]]._

Fancy restaurant in SF I visited [[2022-04-04]].

Went to try their burger which we thought was $17 but was actually $27 lol. I mean come on look at the font.

It was very good. The patty was cooked pretty much perfectly. It could benefit from from the [[Warren's long burgers]] school of thought, but it wasn't prohibitively difficult to eat.

Not mentioned on the menu is the fact that it came with onion rings in the burger (I'm neutral on that) and brie as the cheese (I really liked that). This earned it a 2.5/10 unusualness factor.

Overall I gave it an 8.5/10 on [[The best burger in the bay area]] but I might add that it was pretty heavily rich from the Brie + butter. I wouldn't want to eat 2 in a row even if I had the appetite.
