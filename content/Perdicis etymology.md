# Perdicis etymology
#publish 
Part of [[Perdicis website]], [[Perdicis development]], and [[Rune project]].

I obsessed over this too much but the idea is:
- My last name is "Partridge".
- In Latin, that's "perdix" (nominative) or "perdicis" (genitive).
- The genitive case indicates possession.
- So a phrase like "perdicis puzzles," ignoring the mix of English and Latin, indicates "puzzles by a partridge" or "a partridge's puzzles."
- So, "thing.perdicis.com" means, if you ignore the ".",  "a thing \[owned/made by] a Partridge".
- Which is what notes.perdicis.com is!
