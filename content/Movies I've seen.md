#needswork: Nowhere near the full list and not very organized
Opened [[2024-06-10]]. Related to [[Movies to watch]]. Overlaps with several [[Musings]].

## The list
_A randomly-ordered list, honestly, biased towards things I've seen recently and liked. (!) means I especially liked it. The bottom of this page has the stuff I reeeally, recommend though._

- [[The Boy and the Heron]]
- (!) Dune 1
    - Liked the set design. See it in the original dimensions if possible with a good speaker system, not the cropped streaming version.
- [[Dune 2]] ... liked the original more
- Shogun
- [[Late Night with the Devil]]
- (!) Saving Private Ryan
    - Pretty brutal and authentic. Good costume design and some A list actors
- Feels Good Man (Pepe/Matt Furie documentary)
- (!) The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
    - Surreal storytelling and likeable characters. Nice, bite-sized entertainment
- (!) Love, Death, and Robots
    - Ultra polished, often CGI, bite-sized, self-contained episodes. Occasionally really disturbing lol. I like "Lima Blue" and the yogurt episodes the most.
- O Brother, Where Art Thou
    - I actually preferred the other Russo Bros. films, and didn't like this one much
- Fargo
    - Shaggy dog story like all Russo Bros. films
- The Hurt Locker
- Train to Busan
- (!) Ferris Bueller's Day Off
    - Just good, simpler-times, fun
- The Emperor's New Groove
    - I often pine for this era of American animation
- (!) The French Dispatch
    - I like how artsy it is.
- Squid Game
    - Hot take: I adamantly disliked it for a few reasons I feel compelled to rant about here:
        - Aesthetically: nothing special. Looks like a typical real-world game show.
        - Writing: Bad. Plot twists are unpredictable and make no sense.
        - Symbolism: Also bad (imo). The whole "real enemy is capitalism and greed" rings hollow when your villains are just inherently evil people; them having money is totally separate from those character traits.
- This Place Rules
    - Andrew Callaghan / Channel 5 meme footage movie published by A24 about media echo chambers leading up to the 2021 Capitol riots. Kind of disturbing honestly but played for laughs
- (!) Good Will Hunting
    - Great character drama. Occasionally edgy. Hard to tell how much I like this for being set in Boston and having watched it during my edgy, academia-romanticization phase. Would recommend just for the male chemistry between Matt Damon and Robin Williams.
- Shaolin Soccer
- In Bruges
- Now You See Me
    - The dumbest kind of fun. But fun
- Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
- Goodfellas
- (!) Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse
    - The most aesthetically pleasing animated film I've ever seen. Any still in this film could be turned into a poster.
- The Big Lebowski
- Let It Be (Beatles original footage)
    - Nice to have on in the background but hardly a film.
- The Godfather
- Princess Mononoke
- (!) Spirited Away
    - Everyone loves this one.
- Howl's Moving Castle
- (!) Your Name
    - Made me tear up, even as an anime-neutral person. Likable characters, has an incredibly weak first act, but makes up for it tenfold in its second and third acts. Beautiful art
- Suzume
    - Didn't like it quite as much although the chair was cute
- Bee and Puppycat
- (!) Adventure time
    - Some part of this show tickles my brain. Introducing emotional intelligence to kids in a casual, blink-and-you'll-miss-it type way is the best way to make them internalize it, I think. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy.
- (!) Knives out
- Knives out sequel
    - Meh.
- The Sympathizer
    - Falls into the horror movie trap of `amazingly strong premise + too many shock scenes = disappointing ending that can't explain itself`
    - Lots of frustratingly inconsequential plot threads
    - Sub par casting decisions imo. Especially Robert Downey Jr playing 5 characters for, literally, no really, literally no reason other than probably to Oscar bait us.


## Movies I've seen _and strongly recommend_
Movies
- Exit Through the Gift Shop
    - Currently (as of 2024) my favorite film of all time. _Ask me for the pitch on this film_. The trailer and online summaries totally fail to explain how unlikely and cool it .
- Apollo 11 (CNN film)
    - Pure vibes. Real footage of the Apollo moon landing, lost for decades, then regraded and upscaled and turned into a dramamentary.
- The Grand Budapest Hotel
    - My favorite Wes Anderson film. Incredibly aesthetically compelling, and has a cute, enjoyably unpredictable storyline.

TV shows
- Pantheon - finished [[2024-04-10]]. Wow I love the ending.
    - Budget clearly went 100% into the story and not the animation.
