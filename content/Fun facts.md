These are just the funnest ones.

### The facts

Fun fact for your fun fact collection: the blue windows 10 wallpaper isn't CGI. It's a plexiglass cast photographed in a studio. So an unused animated version of the wallpaper exists: https://youtu.be/vEUytuFek40?si=epiX-rtdyFLYeOsy

Banana candy is designed to taste like a nearly extinct species of banana called the Gros Michel, which until around 1950 was the main variety of banana sold in the USA. It was nearly wiped out worldwide by a banana plague so now we grow a more resilient and also different-tasting variety for sale in supermarkets. Banana candy is a portal to the past

Milk chocolate in England (e.g. Cadbury) tastes totally different than mainstream milk chocolate in America (e.g. Hershey) because the cacao is cut with a different milk additive: powdered milk vs condensed milk respectively. The taste you prefer is largely determined by which one you grew up eating
- Americans prefer the taste they grew up with and vice-versa.
- Stolen from [[History of chocolate]]

Ammunition is a mishearing of la munition as l'ammunition.

"Erm" is not pronounced "urm." It's just British "umm" because you don't pronounce the r sound coming after vowels. It sounds be pronounced "eum" like "umm."

Also I learned a neat fun fact about Salesforce tower, the lights at the top are actually just reflections. The engineers didn't want to mimic the pixely resolution of times square so they made the LEDs face inwards at the white building so they'd be reflected. Which is why it's always so blurry.

Your shadow on a sunny day is a manifestation of light that, having traveled 94 million miles from the sun unobstructed, was deprived of reaching the ground in the final few feet thanks to you.
