# Burning Man prep guide
#publish 
Opened [[2024-09-07]]. Related to [[Burning Man]] and [[Reflections on Burning Man 2024]].

I don't want to be one of those people who writes yet another Burning Man survival guide. But if anyone reading this is thinking of going and wants a guide, I can fill some needs that I noticed the vast majority of prep guides lack:
- _How many_ of each item to bring (e.g. socks -- but how many? Wet wipes and vinegar for the alkaline duist -- but how much?)
    - I have the amounts written down.
- _Which specific items_ are good?
    - I have Amazon links to everything I bought.
- How the BxB (Burner Express bus) works.
    - It's not complicated.
    - Almost every single source I scoured online is outdated.
        - Particularly Reddit, which has really scary stuff like "trash bags cover all the seats on the way back due to dust" and "AC is turned off when you get to playa" ... these things are simply untrue

Just lmk! Writing stuff is fun and if I can help >=1 person I'll do it.




### (Ignore) The play-by-play of burn prep
The rough timeline looks like this.
- Late March 2024: First considered attending the burn
- [[2024-04-20]]: Volunteered pro bono party photography for Infinite Love, the camp I would eventually join
- TODO: Officially accepted and committed to the camp
- TODO: Planned out which camper roles I'll be taking charge of
- [[2024-08-24]]: Caught the bus to Black Rock City.
- [[2024-09-02]]: Caught the bus back to San Francisco.
