# Burning Man prep guide
#publish 
Opened [[2024-09-07]]. Related to [[Burning Man]] and [[Reflections on Burning Man 2024]].

I don't want to be one of those people who writes yet another Burning Man survival guide. But if anyone reading this is thinking of going and wants a guide, I can fill some needs that I noticed the vast majority of prep guides lack:
- _How many_ of each item to bring (e.g. socks -- but how many? Wet wipes and vinegar for the alkaline duist -- but how much?)
    - I have the amounts written down.
- _Which specific items_ are good?
    - I have Amazon links to everything I bought.
- How the BxB (Burner Express bus) works.
    - It's not complicated.
    - Almost every single source I scoured online is outdated.
        - Particularly Reddit, which has really scary stuff like "trash bags cover all the seats on the way back due to dust" and "AC is turned off when you get to playa" ... these things are simply untrue

Just lmk! Writing stuff is fun and if I can help >=1 person I'll do it.




### (Ignore) Notes to myself from before I attended
#### Kim's advice from [[2024-03-26]]
She carries multiple gifts to people of a wide range of quality. She's camped for 8 years; this will be her 9th!

Gifts to the playa ideas/things she's done:
- Fancy lip balm (people's lips get chapped)
- Carabiner-ed gifts for easy carry
- Water sprayers to cool down
- Masks that look pretty since ppl lose theirs?
- Cooling towels: special kind of towel you can wet, shake, and they are cool

She brings 2 thermoses. One is fancy and nice which she keeps at the camp. One is carabiner-ed to her as she walks around.

Camps she's camped with:
- Moon cheese, they do something related to cheese at midnight
- Gravity: they make a big disco ball with DJs and bar. She did this last year. Maybe will again?
- Some Googler-started camp that does giant fire structures

There's some mingling events happening rn that I might want to attend to find a themecamp.
