Boba store in the Embarcadero. Recording my ratings here as part of [[Best boba orders]].

My ratings of this place are pretty controversial among friends. Sharon hates the branding and Lawrence doesn't like the taste. I do like the taste though I acknowledge that the types of drinks sold here are a weird combination of 1/3 traditional boba tea drink, 1/3 Starbucks drink, and 1/3 health drink. But I'll die on the hill of liking how it tastes!

I also think it's neat that a Berkeley grad is running this. Plus pseudo-healthy boba is a great value proposition. I don't love how the tea is marketed with astrology-speak but I can look the other way on that since it tastes good.

## Drinks
### Classic Clouds // "Less sweet" // Inhouse healthy boba
_Chai, cinnamon, ginger, almond milk._
8.25/10.

Cinnamon and chai go great together. I would even get it a tad sweeter next time.

It doesn't taste like a traditional boba drink though. It's more like a watery-tasting Starbucks drink. That sounds bad, and it kind of is. But it's impresssive this can taste so good while being so healthy. It's dumb to write this, but being guiltless while tasting something sweet is a big plus.

### Summer Breeze // No sweetness option // Inhouse healthy boba
_Jasmine green tea with watermelon, lemon, and mint._
8.5/10.

The tea itself was like a 9.25/10; just the right cool flavor and level of sweetness. But the boba texture bumps it down 3/4 of a point. Lychee jelly would have made it a lot better. While that would defeat the point of the tea being healthy, I'm pretty sure that would place this on par with the [[Happy Lemon]] 9.5/10 tea I've had.

### The OG (faux milk tea) // no sweetness adjustments // Keto boba + cinnamon
5/10. Honestly it's not a terrible drink but it tastes nothing like milk. It's very watery.

It's definitely healthy though but this time I didn't have that influence my rating much. It was pretty so-so. Not much flavor aside from vaguely tea-flavored, vaguely milk-flavored, something-in-between beverage taste.


### 0 brown sugar matcha plus Viva and steak bulk milk

Boba was warm

Couldn't have told you it was healthy it's just a normal matcha drink plus less sweet n boba 

I think I forgot to rate this one lol.
