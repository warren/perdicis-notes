Opened [[2024-03-23]]. But originally learned of it [[2024-02-08]].

I'll let the site speak for itself:

I signed up a day later on [[2024-03-24]] with the following answers to their prompts:

**Name**: Avery (I like the androgynousness of it)

**Where are you at in your life stage?**
In my mind I'm partly aloof; partly rooted in SF. I moved here after college from New England and have been drinking up so many new experiences. Most of my friends and all of my family stayed behind, so it's been sort of like a fresh start for me here, which I like. Savoring the transience of brief yet passionate hobbies, warm friendships, novel music, short apartment leases, ...

**How's your life?**
Fulfilling! I felt a bit out of my element for a while but have learned to ride the wave of uncertainty towards a cozy equilibrium. Life is good.

**What helps you keep your sanity?**
The little things, like daily Muni rides barely long enough to finish a chapter of the book I'm reading (currently: The Three Body Problem - no spoilers for the Netflix show!). And the big things, like working on my daily journal/mind mapping project. I've been at that for >2 years and am celebrating sticking to something for so long.

**What is most important to you right now?**
Leaving a positive mark in my community. But if I'm being honest I spend more time absorbing bits of culture from other communities than giving back to my own. There's just so much to see out there and I want to make sure I give back in the right way. I'd like to leave a positive footprint eventually. I guess figuring out how to do that is the most important thing I'm prioritizing now.

**Anything you recently found interesting?**
Oh so many things! I'm a purveyor of fun facts. A fun one about SF is: the Richmond and Sunset Districts were originally called the "Outside Lands" due to being sandy and largely roadless. That's where the music festival in GGP gets its name!
