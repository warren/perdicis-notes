Opened [[2023-09-04]] after getting struck by inspiration again. [[Musings]] / [[Musings on everything else]]?

#### Bo Chen (Irelia artist)
Bo Chen's process struck me as it was totally different from what I've seen before.
1) Rough B&W sketch
2) Liquify until it looks like what you want
3) Fill subject(s) grey via lasso tool
    1) Different subjects on different layers
    2) Different shades of grey depending on their relevance to the drawing
4) Lasso tool again to darken the relevant greys (e.g. hair, armor, texture in the background)
5) Airbrush in the semi-fine details
6) Do a final liquify step
7) Drop a multiply layer over everything to give it a hue to follow for the rest of the piece

Or just replace Steps 3-5 with airbrushing hues and colors.

Other fascinating quirks about Bo:
- Linear light tool --> flashy light
- Overlay --> color for clothes (Bo uses this a lot)
- Duplicates layers a LOT
    - Maybe I need a PC to do this workflow lmao
    - Bo lassos relevant bits of his pieces out a lot
    - When doing new things, he tries a new layer first then merges
